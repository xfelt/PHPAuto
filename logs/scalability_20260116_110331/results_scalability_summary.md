# Scalability Benchmark Summary

Generated: 2026-01-16 11:03:42

## Configuration

- Model: RUNS_SupEmis_Cplex_PLM_Tax.mod
- Carbon Tax: 0 (baseline emissions)
- Time Limit: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
- Service Time: 1
- Suppliers: 10

## Key Findings

- **First N with runtime > 60s:** Not reached in tested range
- **First N with runtime > 300s:** Not reached in tested range
- **First N with TIMEOUT:** Not reached in tested range
- **Infeasible instances:** None

## Scaling Pattern Analysis

Observed runtime scaling:
- Small instances (N < 10): 1s
- Medium instances (10 <= N < 30): 0.66s
- Large instances (N >= 30): 0.17s

## Assumptions and Notes

- Missing BOM files were generated by expanding from the closest available size
- Time limit enforced at model level via cplex.tilim parameter
- Baseline emissions (E₀) recorded for each instance size
- Buffer count estimated from decision variables when available
