In order to Evaluate how BOM topology and depth affect:

+ inventory buffer positioning,

+ sourcing decisions,

+ total cost,

+ baseline carbon emissions,

under a pure cost-optimization regime (no carbon tax, no emission cap).


This unified scenario serves as:

1. a structural sensitivity benchmark (serial / parallel / mixed),

2. a realistic feasibility anchor for deep, industrial-scale BOMs,

3. the baseline emissions reference for all subsequent carbon policy scenarios


Your task is to execute a structured benchmark campaign combining multi-level structural BOMs and realistic large BOM instances, using the linearized CPLEX model, in order to analyze topology-driven effects on KPIs and establish robust baseline emissions.


1) Scope: Two Complementary Instance Families (Same Scenario)


This scenario includes two families of BOM instances, both already available.


Family A — Multi-Level Structural BOMs (Controlled Depth & Size)

These instances isolate the effect of BOM depth and topology.


Naming convention (already added): bom_supemis_ml<M>_<N>.csv


Where:

+ M = number of BOM levels (depth)

+ N = total number of nodes/components


Topology rules:

+ include serial paths, convergent assemblies, and divergent branches,

+ same supplier pool logic across depths (no artificial supplier inflation).


Family B — Realistic Large-Scale BOMs (Topology Variability)

These instances represent realistic industrial BOMs, with heterogeneous topology.


Naming convention (already added): bom_supemis_par<i>.csv


Where:

i = instance index (topology variation)


Rules:

+ similar size range (?80–150 nodes),

+ different internal structures (assembly density, branching, depth),

+ realistic mix of raw materials and subassemblies.


2) Input Data (Common to All Runs)

For each instance (both families):


BOM file:

+ bom_supemis_ml<M>_<N>.csv or

+ bom_supemis_par<i>.csv

Supplier list:

+ size-matched supp_list_<N>.csv

Supplier details:

+ supp_details_supeco.csv

Use supp_details_supeco_grdCapacity.csv only if infeasibility appears due to capacity saturation (log this explicitly).


3) Model and Solver Configuration


Solver model:

RUNS_SupEmis_Cplex_PLM_Tax.mod


Carbon policy:

+ carbon tax = 0

+ no emission cap

+ emissions are computed but inactive in the objective


Deterministic setup:

+ identical solver parameters across all runs

+ fixed seed (if applicable)


Runtime limit:

1800 seconds per instance


4) Execution Protocol

For each BOM instance:

1. Load the BOM and corresponding supplier data.

2. Run the CPLEX solver with identical settings.

3. Capture solution status and KPIs.

4. Store outputs in a unified results table.


Do not stop on infeasibility:

+ log it,

+ continue with remaining instances.


5) KPIs to Extract (Mandatory)

For each run:


Structural & Performance KPIs

+ instance_id

+ family ? {ML, PAR}

+ M (depth, if ML)

+ N (number of nodes)

+ runtime_sec

+ solver_status

+ objective_value

+ number_of_buffers

+ average_buffer_level (if available)


Sourcing & Inventory KPIs

+ number_of_suppliers_used

+ average_lead_time (if computed)

+ total_inventory_cost (if separable)


Baseline Sustainability KPI

+ total_CO2_emissions ? critical


6) Output Artifacts

1. Consolidated CSV:

results_structural_realistic_baseline.csv


Required columns:

instance_id, family, M, N, runtime_sec, solver_status, objective_value, buffers_count, suppliers_used, total_emissions


Logs:

logs/structural_realistic/run_<instance_id>.log


Summary markdown:

results_structural_realistic_summary.md


Include:

+ comparison of emissions across depths (ML),

+ emission dispersion across realistic topologies (PAR),

+ buffer positioning stability vs depth,

+ any infeasibility patterns.


7) Interpretation Rule (Important)

Treat all emissions computed here as baseline emissions (E?):

+ E?(M, N) for multi-level structural cases,

+ E?(i) for realistic topology cases.


These values will be reused unchanged as reference points for:

+ emission cap tightening,

+ hybrid tax + cap scenarios,

+ marginal abatement cost analysis.


Do not normalize or adjust emissions at this stage.


8) Quality Control


Before full execution:

smoke-test:

+ one ml3_20,

+ one ml5_60,

+ one par1.


Verify:

+ feasibility,

+ emissions extraction,

+ result logging.


If OK, launch full batch.


Deliverable Expectation (Article-Ready)


This scenario must allow you to state clearly:


“Before introducing any environmental regulation, emission levels are primarily driven by BOM topology and depth, even under identical cost-optimal sourcing rules.”
